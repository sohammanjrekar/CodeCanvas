## üöÄ About This Repository

Welcome to CodeCanvas! This repository is a personal chronicle of my journey into frontend development. It contains a diverse collection of 20+ web applications and mini-projects, each built from scratch using only vanilla **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

The goal of this collection is to practice and demonstrate fundamental web development skills, from creating responsive layouts and interactive UIs to fetching data from APIs and managing application state.
